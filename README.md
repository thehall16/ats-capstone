still need to figure out what LCD to use./ Display (maybe LCD maybe a Uart serial port connection)

Moved Firmware to Keil to easily use stm32cubemx for hal librarys and pin configuration.

Getting accurate readings from ZMPT101B display currently via uart and puTTY terminal.

Daughter board is in waiting on one componet to fully assemble

Reworking main PCB may use nucleo board instead of standalone mcu due to time constraint
aswell as code being formatted for the nucleo currently.

May need a new 12v power supply the cheap ups scares me.

We're gonna need a bigger boat (AC side housing for isolation).
